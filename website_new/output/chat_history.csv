Sigatoka disease is very serious for banana plants, though it is not harmful to humans.

It destroys the leaves, which act as the plant's food factory. This leads to:
*   **Smaller fruit bunches** (lower yield).
*   **Poor quality fruit** that may ripen too soon.
*   A weakened plant overall.

Following the sanitation and spray steps I mentioned earlier is crucial to control the spread and protect your harvest."
