  "answer": "The query mentions banana leaves drying up, but the provided context is about coconut crops.  I need information about the banana crop to help.  Please provide details about the banana plants, including:\n\n* **Location:** Specific region or area where the bananas are grown.\n* **Weather conditions:** Recent rainfall, temperature, humidity levels, and any unusual weather events.\n* **Plant age and variety:**  The age of the banana plants and the specific variety.\n* **Irrigation:** How often are the plants watered, and what is the water source?\n* **Soil:** Soil type, drainage, and nutrient levels.  Have you had a soil test recently?\n* **Fertilization:** What type and amount of fertilizer have you applied recently?\n* **Pest and disease:** Have you observed any pests or diseases on the plants?  Describe any symptoms you see beyond the leaf drying.\n* **Image:**  While the provided image is for a coconut plant, if you have an image of the affected banana leaves, that would be very helpful.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide more specific advice.",
