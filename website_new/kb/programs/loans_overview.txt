Agricultural Loans & Interest Subvention
Overview

This document explains short-term crop loans, interest subvention schemes and prompt repayment incentives (PRI) that reduce cost of borrowing for farmers.

Key elements

Short-term crop loans for cultivation are often covered under interest subvention schemes (government pays part of interest to banks).

Prompt repayment incentives further reduce effective rates for timely repayment.

Schemes and rates change over time â€” always verify current year notifications.

Practical guidance

Use KCC as entry route to formal credit.

Check state/national circulars for eligible loan ceilings and subvention rates.
