Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
Overview

PMFBY is the central crop insurance scheme that protects farmers against yield loss due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It stabilises incomes and ensures credit flow.

Key points

Enrollment is crop & season specific and notified by the state.

Farmers may enrol via bank branches (linked with crop loans), CSCs, insurance company portals or agriculture offices.

Premium rates and sum insured rules vary by crop and season; government often subsidises part of the premium.

Claims follow area-yield or individual farm loss assessment depending on the notified method.

Practical steps

Encourage early enrolment and keep receipts.

Maintain evidence of cultivation and damage (photos, witness statements) for claims.

File claims promptly per notified timelines and follow the insurerâ€™s process.

Notes & verification

Confirm current premium rates, notified crops and claim procedure on the PMFBY / state portal before advising.
