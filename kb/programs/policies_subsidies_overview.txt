Policies & Subsidies — Guide for Extension
Overview

Practical approach

Maintain a short list of state nodal portals and contact points for each subsidy program.

Collect vendor invoices, application receipts, and land proofs as per the specific scheme’s checklist.

For complex schemes, route the farmer to block-level officers or FPO support cells.
